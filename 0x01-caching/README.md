# Caching Back-end README

## Overview

Welcome to the Caching Back-end repository! This project focuses on implementing caching techniques in a back-end system. Caching is a method of storing frequently accessed data in a high-speed storage area to reduce latency and improve performance. This readme provides essential information on setting up, configuring, and using the caching back-end system.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd caching-backend
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or if you prefer yarn
   yarn install
   ```

## Configuration

Before running the caching back-end, you need to configure the system. Create a configuration file (e.g., `config.js`) and specify the necessary settings such as cache expiration time, maximum cache size, and any other relevant configurations.

Here's an example of a basic configuration file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  cacheExpirationTime: 3600, // Cache expiration time in seconds (1 hour)
  maxCacheSize: 100, // Maximum number of items that can be stored in the cache
  // Add more configurations as needed
};
```

## Usage

To start the caching back-end, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
# or with yarn
yarn start
```

This command will start the server, and it will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`. You can make requests to this server to test the caching functionality.

Example API endpoint to cache data:

```http
POST http://localhost:3000/api/data
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "key": "exampleKey",
  "value": "exampleValue"
}
```

Example API endpoint to retrieve cached data:

```http
GET http://localhost:3000/api/data?key=exampleKey
```
