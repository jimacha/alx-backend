Welcome to the Pagination Backend Project! This project is designed to provide efficient and seamless pagination functionality for your applications. Whether you're dealing with a large dataset or simply want to improve the user experience, this project has got you covered.


## Introduction

Pagination is a critical component in many applications, enabling users to navigate through a large set of data in smaller, more manageable chunks. This backend project provides a robust and customizable solution for implementing pagination in your applications. It allows you to divide your data into pages, making it easier for users to navigate and find the information they need.

## Features

- **Efficient Data Handling**: Handle large datasets efficiently by dividing them into smaller pages.
- **Customizable**: Tailor pagination settings to match your specific requirements, such as the number of items per page.
- **Seamless Integration**: Easily integrate the pagination functionality into your existing backend systems.
- **Flexible API**: The API is designed to be flexible and can be adapted to various data sources and formats.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling to ensure smooth user experience even in unexpected situations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: This project is built using Node.js. Download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd pagination-backend
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To use the pagination functionality in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Import the Pagination Module**:

   ```javascript
   const Pagination = require('pagination-module');
   ```

2. **Create a Pagination Instance**:

   ```javascript
   const paginator = new Pagination(data, itemsPerPage);
   ```

   - `data`: An array of items you want to paginate.
   - `itemsPerPage`: The number of items to display per page.

3. **Get Paginated Data**:

   ```javascript
   const currentPage = 1;
   const paginatedData = paginator.getPage(currentPage);
   ```

   This will return an array of items for the specified page.

4. **Handle Navigation**:

   You can handle user navigation by calling `paginator.getPage(pageNumber)` with the desired page number.
